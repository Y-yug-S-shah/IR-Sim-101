Security Recommendations
======================

1. Immediate Actions:
   - Block all malicious IPs and domains listed in IOC list at firewall and proxy level
   - Isolate compromised hosts from the network
   - Revoke exposed admin credentials and force password reset organization-wide

2. Containment & Eradication:
   - Remove malicious binaries (`winupdate.exe`, `syncservice.dll`) from all endpoints
   - Clear malicious registry persistence entries
   - Terminate suspicious RDP and SMB sessions
   - Disable PsExec execution in the environment

3. Network Hardening:
   - Implement strict outbound traffic rules for non-standard ports
   - Enable TLS certificate pinning for critical applications
   - Deploy deep packet inspection (DPI) to detect encrypted C2 traffic
   - Configure DNS filtering to block tunneling attempts

4. Monitoring & Detection:
   - Set up Splunk queries for detecting beaconing patterns with fixed intervals
   - Monitor for unusual file transfer volumes during off-hours
   - Enable logging for PowerShell, WMI, and PsExec activity

5. Long-Term Recommendations:
   - Conduct phishing awareness training focusing on malicious macros
   - Enforce MFA for all privileged accounts
   - Regularly rotate service account credentials
   - Establish a threat hunting routine focused on Cobalt Strike and ransomware TTPs
   - Subscribe to updated threat intel feeds for early IOC detection
