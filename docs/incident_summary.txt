Incident Summary – Day 4 (Root Cause Analysis & Lessons Learned)

Incident Title: Unauthorized Remote Access to Internal Workstation
Incident ID: SOC-2025-IR-001

Date of Incident: 2025-08-05  
Date of Report: 2025-08-08  
Prepared by: Yug Shah

Summary:
On 5th August 2025, a security incident was detected involving unauthorized remote access to an internal workstation (hostname: HR-WS-22). Initial detection occurred via Splunk alerts triggered by abnormal RDP login activity from an external IP address. The attacker leveraged stolen credentials obtained from a phishing campaign targeting HR department employees.

Root Cause:
The root cause was traced to a phishing email sent to the HR department. One employee opened a malicious attachment, which executed a credential-stealing malware. The stolen credentials were later used to log into HR-WS-22 from an external IP. MFA was not enabled on the RDP service, making the compromise easier.

Timeline:
- 05-Aug-2025 10:14: Splunk alert triggered (Unusual RDP login)
- 05-Aug-2025 10:15: Analyst review confirms suspicious activity
- 05-Aug-2025 10:20: Incident escalated to Incident Response Team
- 05-Aug-2025 10:25: RDP session terminated, workstation isolated
- 05-Aug-2025 10:40: Memory dump and forensic image collected
- 05-Aug-2025 12:00: IOC enrichment completed; external IP linked to known threat actor “APT-Cobra”
- 06-Aug-2025 09:30: Malware sample analyzed – identified as credential stealer (variant of RedLine)
- 07-Aug-2025 15:00: Root cause analysis completed – confirmed phishing campaign as source
- 08-Aug-2025 09:00: Lessons learned session conducted

Impact:
- Compromised user account (HR department staff)
- Potential exposure of sensitive HR documents (no confirmed exfiltration)
- Temporary downtime for affected workstation

Remediation Steps Taken:
1. Isolated infected workstation from the network.
2. Disabled compromised user account and reset all HR department credentials.
3. Removed malware from the system and performed OS reinstallation.
4. Implemented MFA on all RDP-enabled systems.
5. Updated phishing awareness training for HR department.

Lessons Learned:
- MFA should be enforced on all remote access systems.
- Regular phishing awareness training significantly reduces risk.
- Splunk correlation searches should be tuned for more aggressive detection of unusual login patterns.
- Phishing email reporting needs to be actively encouraged and rewarded.

Follow-up Actions:
- Conduct targeted phishing simulations for HR department (scheduled for September 2025).
- Deploy EDR solution on all endpoints for better real-time detection.
- Review and update Incident Response playbooks to include faster RDP compromise handling.
